in this we have to rotate the array in such way that there in a array that if we have given a k value and from that value we have to rotate the array

for that we have the approch of the modulus % that is we have to start from(i+k)%n
where numsize() is the total size and i is there loop trizersing element and then the k is value from where the rray has to rotate.




class Solution{
    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
         vector<int> temp(nums.size());  
        for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++){
            temp[(i+k)%nums.size()]=nums[i];
        }
        nums=temp;
    }
};
